👋 Hi, I’m @jcyling <br>
👀 I’m interested in making web applications. <br>
🌎 Currently working on Long Distance Friends, a scheduling web app for friends & family in different timezones. <br>
🌱 Learning JavaScript, Python, React, and the MERN stack. And dipping a little bit into processing/p5.js. <br>
